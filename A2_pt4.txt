I vectorized the merging of all of the copies of the decks of cards with the use of `replicate()` and using `do.call` with `rbind`. In order to create the needed `point` column, instead of multiple complicated `ifelse()` statements, I use preallocated vector space and use logic to fill in the values accordingly. Instead of `nrow()` I use `dim()` to get the number of rows. This code increased in speed due to the avoidance of a `for` loop and other messy practices. Checking both results with `all.equal()` shows that both results are the same.
